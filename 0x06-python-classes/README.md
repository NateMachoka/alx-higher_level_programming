# Square Class

This project defines a Python class called `Square` that represents a square with a private size attribute. It also includes a method to calculate the area of the square.

## Usage

To use the `Square` class, import it into your Python script and create instances as needed.

```python
from square import Square

# Create a square with size 5
my_square = Square(5)

# Calculate the area of the square
area = my_square.area()
print(f"The area of the square is: {area}")
