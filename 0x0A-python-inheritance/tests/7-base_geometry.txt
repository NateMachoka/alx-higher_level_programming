# Custom Tests for the module 7-base_geometry.py

* The class BaseGeometry is expected to have two public instance methods:
  - area()
  - integer_validator(name, value)

## Constraints

* The area() method raises an Exception with the message "area() is not implemented."
* The integer_validator method validates the value:
  - name is always a string.
  - If value is not an integer, it raises a TypeError with the message "<name> must be an integer."
  - If value is less than or equal to 0, it raises a ValueError with the message "<name> must be greater than 0."
